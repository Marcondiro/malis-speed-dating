- [x] Dataset analysis @Marco
    - [x] Features description (including domain)
    - [x] Reload data with sensible dataformat ?
    - [x] Find useless features
    - [x] Remove features not retrievable by the app
    - [x] Map textual fields into categorical features
    - [ ] Rename OneHotEncoded columns with category name.
    - [x] Produce a dataframe as output

- [ ] Prediction
    - [x] Prepare data function (train/validation/test split) @Ilaria
    - [x] Evaluate model function @Ilaria
    - [ ] Algorithms @Mayank
        - [ ] k-nn
        - [ ] logistic regression
        - [ ] svm

- [ ] Understand how to handle imbalance in the dataset @All
- [ ] Write how we will manage missing categories in the dataset when will implement the model
- [ ] Choose the portion for th TVT split

- [ ] Update report
    - [ ] Motivation @Ilaria
    - [ ] Dataset_analysys stuff @Marco
        - [ ] 1-hot en @Ilaria
    - [ ] Methods @Mayank
        - [ ] Say that we use K-fold + grid search
        - [ ] Used metrics
        - [ ] Unbalance management (no accuracy, other metrics... Stratified stuff)
        - [ ] Bad performance and link to next steps for the resolutions
    - [ ] Next steps @Ilaria
        - [ ] Other ML techniques
        - [ ] Unbalance management (Oversampling, point 2, 8 ,9 ilaria link)
        - [x] Data trasformation
            - [x] interactions between same cols and with all cols
